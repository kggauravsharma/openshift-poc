# OpenShift Proof of Concept

This repository aims to host information needed to install Red Hat OpenShift
Container Platform. Focus is on a High Availability reference installation.

## Platform details
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux **7.5**
* Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform **3.9**

## Link Collection
* [Logical Architecture and Bill of Materials](http://redhat.slides.com/sspreitz/openshift-poc?token=b1Yx77VW), page 5 & 6
* [Prerequisites](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/3.9/single/installation_and_configuration/index#install-config-install-prerequisites)
* [Host Preparation](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/3.9/single/installation_and_configuration/index#install-config-install-host-preparation)
* [Advanced Installation](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/3.9/single/installation_and_configuration/index#install-config-install-advanced-install)

The mentioned node sizes (not masters or loadbalancer) are the minimum prerequisites as of the documentation.
Based on my experience it is a good rule of thumb to double the node size for a normal user experience, quadruple for a very good user experience.

<b style="color:red">Very important: The resources you apply to an OpenShift cluster should be fully reserved. There should not be any resource stealing from other VMs or memory, cpu, storage, network over-commitment. Otherwise the Kubernetes resource quotas will have no effect and application developers can not rely on the performance of the  platform.</b>

## Example inventory
* [hosts](/hosts.v3.9)

## DNS
All hosts listed in the inventory file must be resolvable to the interface where OpenShift traffic is intended.

Additionally to the hosts in the inventory there must be defined three DNS aliases;
1. The internal api endpoint DNS, eg. *internal-ocp.example.com*, resolving to the loadbalancer nodes LAN address, which forwards the traffic to the masters
2. The external api endpoint DNS, eg. *ocp.example.com*, resolving to an external/internet facing loadbalancer, which forwards traffic also to the masters
3. A wildcard DNS, eg *\*.apps.example.com*, that will be forwarded to the OpenShift routers

*Entries could also be added via the host preparation to /etc/hosts.*

### DNS example

|FQDN|IP|
|---:|---:|
|ocp-lb-1.ocp.example.com|192.168.0.2|
|ocp-master-1.ocp.example.com|192.168.0.3|
|ocp-master-2.ocp.example.com|192.168.0.4|
|ocp-master-3.ocp.example.com|192.168.0.5|
|ocp-node-1.ocp.example.com|192.168.0.6|
|ocp-node-2.ocp.example.com|192.168.0.7|
|ocp-node-3.ocp.example.com|192.168.0.8|
|ocp-node-4.ocp.example.com|192.168.0.9|
|ocp-node-5.ocp.example.com|192.168.0.10|
|internal-ocp.example.com|192.168.0.2|
|ocp.example.com|192.168.0.2|
|*.apps.example.com|192.168.0.2|

## Storage
NFS storage is obsolete as of version 3.9 of this PoC.

This PoC makes use of GlusterFS and Heketi deployed inside OpenShift (Container Native Storage - CNS). **Please make sure there is an additional disk available with at least 200GB space on the first three nodes.** See the glusterfs group in the inventory file. Check and change the device name if needed, eg. ```/dev/sdb```.

## RHEL 7.5
*RHEL 7.5* makes use of *docker-1.13.1* and uses *overlay2* instead of *devicemapper* docker-storage. Thus an additional disk for docker is no longer needed, just make sure your system disk is sufficient in space (+75GB) or make (local attached) space available at ```/var/lib/docker```.

## Sidenotes
Despite OpenShift deploys routers on nodes labeled as *region=infra*, it is expected, that an existing enterprise grade loadbalancer (eg. F5) is used to forward the traffic from the wildcard DNS to the *region=infra* nodes.

But the deployed loadbalancer host in the example inventory can be used and the forwarding can be added there. *An example for this is on the TODO list*
